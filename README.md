## Recommendations

* `If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)` If I was advising the company, I may suggest Upstart to offer a platform to robo or manual investing in stock market. They already have a large customer base which may be untapped in terms of additional products and services. They are already utilizing machine learning and AI for lending, they can utilize existing infrastructure and resources to develop stock / ETF trend and price forecasting and also offer an option to extend loan for the investment if the individual desires. Another option is to let users / private companies invest in peer to peer loan business. This can help them infuse cash from investors. They can create a passive income stream for these investors.
###
* `Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?` Upstart can benefit from interest cost from loans taken out by aspiring investors. They can also strike a deal with same set of financial institutions to act as a broker to channel investments.
###
* `What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?` The products and services will utilize same set of technologies and infrastructure for offering this new set of services to their customers
###
* `Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?` The company already has experience in using current technologies and infrastructure. The team will require minimal training and can hit the ground runing with the new services to their existing customers. Further there are many algorithms already available on the web for doing forecasting of an individual stock.
