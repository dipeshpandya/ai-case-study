## Recommendations

* `If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)` If I was advising the company, I may suggest Upstart to offer a platform to robo or manual investing in stock market. They already have a large customer base which may be untapped in terms of additional products and services. They are already utilizing machine learning and AI for lending, they can utilize existing infrastructure and resoures tp develop stock / etf trend and price forecasting and also offer an option to extend loan for the investment if the individual desires. Another option is to let users / private companies invest in peer to peer loan business. This can help them infuse cash from investors. They can create a passive income stream for theese investors.
